# TUIOSwift

TUIOSwift is a Swift Implementation of the [TUIO library] (http://tuio.org/?software) by Martin Kalternbrunner. It is a 1:1 port of the original [TUIO 1.1 Java Library] (http://github.com/mkalten/TUIO11_JAVA)

It utilises [MetatoneOSC] (https://github.com/cpmpercussion/MetatoneOSC) Objective-C library for OSC that is integrated in this repo for convenience sake.
