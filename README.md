# TUIOSwift

TUIOSwift is a Swift Implementation of the [TUIO library](http://tuio.org/?software) by Martin Kalternbrunner. It is a 1:1 port of the original [TUIO 1.1 Java Library](http://github.com/mkalten/TUIO11_JAVA)

It also uses parts of the TUIO Simulator, to provide client-side and server-side code.


Currently the library is only partially finished and only of limited funcitonality.

This fork aims to finish the cursor support for 2DCur objects
